* Info
Currently the addon synchronizes with following services:
- Anilist
- Simkl

I plan on adding the following in the near future:
- MyAnimelist
- Kitsu
- Trakt

** Goal
I want to implement a two way sync over multiple services with Stremio acting as the _Sender_ and the watchlists acting as the _Receivers_.

** Help
If you want to help, the next step is adding mappings between the services to a generalized format.

*** Syncing
The idea is that everything is the same everywhere. So a mapping to check what should be synced would look like:

#+begin_src typescript
  let lastWatched;
  if (symkl.last_watched_at > stremio.state.lastWatched) {
    lastWatched = symkl.last_watched_at;
  } else if (anilist.mediaEntry.last_watched) {
    lastWatched = anilist.mediaEntry.last_watched;
  }
#+end_src

*** Mapping
Information should be mapped as much as possible. After deciding the leader of the sync, we get all possible values and fill up the rest:
#+begin_src typescript
  // If Symkl has lastWatched
  if (symkl.state === "completed") {
    stremio.state.flaggedAsWatched = true
    anilist.state = "COMPLETED"
  }
  // If Anilist has lastWatched
  if (symkl.state === "COMPLETED") {
    stremio.state.flaggedAsWatched = true
    symcl.state = "completed"
  }
#+end_src

** WARNING
I have tested this as good as possible. Everything published here is currently good to go and shouldn't mess up your library. That said if anything does happen... I can't guarantee anything. Open up an Issue and I may be able to help out.

* ToDo

** Dynamic Sync
Dynamic Sync is when an item in the _Senders_ is updated, that it get's reflected on the _Receivers_.

- [X] Dynamic Sync from Stremio to Anilist
- [ ] Dynamic Sync from Stremio to Kitsu
- [ ] Dynamic Sync from Stremio to MyAnimelist
- [X] Dynamic Sync from Stremio to Simkl
- [-] Dynamic Sync from Stremio to Trakt (Already native Support use that)

** Import Sync
Import Sync is theoretically a one-time action where the whole library get's synchronised from the _Senders_ to the _Receivers_ and vice-versa. But the plan is, that this can be run multiple times without wierd issues.

- [ ] Import Sync from Stremio to Anilist
- [ ] Import Sync from Stremio to Kitsu
- [ ] Import Sync from Stremio to MyAnimelist
- [-] Import Sync from Stremio to Simkl (Alternative until tested: [[https://github.com/aliyss/simkl-stremio][simkl-stremio]])
- [-] Import Sync from Stremio to Trakt (Alternative until tested: [[https://github.com/aliyss/trakt-stremio-import][trakt-stremio-import]])

** Advanced Sync
Advanced Sync is when the theoretical _Receivers_ share their data between each other, validating and keeping each other in sync.

- [ ] Sync between all Receivers

** Two-Way Sync
Of course I'm going for the two-way sync. However this is harder than it actually seems at the moment. Due to not knowing what the prefered sync order is.

** Catalogs
Stremio Catalog Support, self explanatory if you are using stremio.

- [X] Anilist
- [ ] Kitsu
- [ ] MyAnimelist
- [X] Simkl
- [ ] Trakt

* Use the Addon

[[https://56bca7d190fc-syncribullet.baby-beamup.club/][Click here!]]

* Modify and Build yourself

** Build

#+begin_src bash
npm install
npm run build
#+end_src

** Start
Start the program. Then open the browser at the url mentioned, if this doesn't already happen automatically.

#+begin_src bash
npm run start
#+end_src

** Develop
Instead of _Start_. Use the following. This will allow you to see the changes live.

#+begin_src bash
npm run start:dev
#+end_src

* Known Issues
 * Authtokens are not updated if they expire. I'm working on that.

* What else?

** Naming
I chose the name SyncriBullet, because I want to blend all of the tracking websites together in a synchronised mix. There's not much more to it.

** Pull Requests
Feel free to open pull requests if you think there can be improvements made. I will add an eslint check asap.

** Stars
A star would be kind, but honestly I use GitHub stars more as bookmarks. So instead bookmark it.
